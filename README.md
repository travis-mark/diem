# Diem - What day is it?

This started off as a goofy one-off because I thought day of year
was missing from UNIX [date](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html). 
Spoiler: it's `%j`. So, I wrote a ten line Objective-C program to emit `Day ##`.

I realized having a few pieces of data on my watch like, "Today is the 
2nd Thursday which means I need to move my car" would be useful. Now it's an
app that I can't ship because everything is hard-coded. 

I might change that someday.
